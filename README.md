## Simple Scheme written in Haskell

I'm writing a compiler for simple version of [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) using Haskell.
There is a 99.6% chance of it breaking down and crashing into depths of Hell.
It's not supposed to be very well written nor is it supposed to be used for anything other than learning how to write things in Haskell
